# Udacity Front-End Neighborhood Map Project

This project, a responsive single page application featuring a map and list of locations, was developed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The project guidelines called for the use of the Google Maps API to create a map complete with location information provided by third-party API data (in this case, Flickr and Wikipedia). In addition, the Knockout JS framework was used to maintain and handle the state and functionality of the location list. Other technology and resources used include jQuery, Bootstrap, Jasny Bootstrap, and Owl Carousel.

## Instructions

1. After cloning or downloading this repository, open index.html in a web browser. Alternatively, you may visit the web page [here](https://abequinonez.github.io/udacity-frontend-map). Since much of the application relies on API requests at runtime, an active internet connection is required.

2. When the application successfully finishes loading, you may click on locations from either the list or on the map itself. Location results may be filtered using the input box.
